#### Overview

The Fundación Arquitectura y Ciudad (FAC) is a non-profit organization created in November 2015 whose main objective is to support the generation and dissemination of knowledge in the field of architecture, urban planning, the technological development of construction and related areas, as well as the preservation of the Venezuelan historical heritage.

#### My Role

When The FAC, began their medium of communication was through a weekly newsletter that is still being sent every Sunday. I was approached to present a project of a blog/website that could work as an archive of the content of said newsletter, so that people that isn't subscribed to it can check what's been sent in the previous editions of the newsletter.
\
\
After doing some research I found and presented a Wordpress theme that has all the functions that I had been asked to find. Then, after updating the blog with enough content, I received the green light to launch it. Then I created a document with instructions on how upload content to the blog so that every interested member can update the site at their own pace.
\
\
Also, I worked in keeping the site optimized for SEO and now it's showing in the first result page of Google.
\
\
Currently, I'm doing constant checkups on the quality of the content and the speed of the site. Also on how it's performing in Google Search Console.

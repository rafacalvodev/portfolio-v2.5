This is the part where I felt more comfortable. And I have to say it: I enjoy writing CSS. Of course I haven't reached the level of doing those awesome illustrations, like those made by [Jhey Tompkins](https://twitter.com/jh3yy), or creating other fantastic stuff, but nevertheless I'm enjoying CSS (and Sass) a lot.

\
Again, when I was exploring ideas for how to style the site I had, again, my fair share of options. I explored the "cool kids" of CSS frameworks like Tailwind and Bootstrap (whose next version has me excited), or Bulma and Materialize. But in the end I decided for ol' reliable CSS.
\
\
Why? Again, freedom and familiarity (although if it's for familiarity I'd went with Bootstrap ðŸ˜‚). I feel more comfortable writing pure CSS/Sass than using any framework (of course, I'll keep use them, but still), and even after some time you kinda develop an "eye" to immediately see when a framework's been used, like the border radius of some buttons or how do some navbar look, even the color palette of some sites make you say: "Ah this is made with Bootstrap". But in the end, it's personal preference, and I choose this way.
\
\
For the folder structure of my styles I went with [Sass Guidelines Architecture Example](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture), only that for this one I made my own structure.
\
\
For the modular part of Sass, I remembered Kevin Powell's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR-a8upNjJ0) in which he talks about stopping the use of `@import` and to take the habit of using `@use` and `@forward`, and began to apply what he said for this site. Also, I'm using some mixins for the responsive part of the site. Of course, I'm also doing my best to keep this site as accessible as possible by following the guidelines showed [here](https://a11y-style-guide.com/style-guide/) and [here](https://www.a11yproject.com/).
\

Basically I'm using this site as a playground for a bunch of stuff and in the future I'll probably add a "Playground" section in my portfolio for all the experimental stuff I try.

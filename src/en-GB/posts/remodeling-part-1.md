Picking the color of your project can be tricky and you can lose time wondering through color pickers, especially if it's for your personal website or portfolio. You want its primary color to be a color you're comfortable with and that it shows some identity to the site. Then comes a color palette that matches that first color you picked.
\
\
For this site I'm using `#5f5fff` (also called Neon Blue) as the primary color because I liked it when I first made the logo a few months back and used to fill the letters and it clicked with me. After "locking" that color I used [Color Space](https://mycolor.space/) to generate a palette based on that blue and [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to store the resulting palette.

[Color Space](https://mycolor.space/) is a very useful tool if you want to create a color palette "on the fly". To use it all you need to do is insert the hex code of the color you have, hit the "Generate" button and the site will do its magic.

#### Coolors

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) is one of my favorite tools to store and play with palettes. If you have an account you can store any palettes you make, if not, you can create a palette and download it for futures use (if any).

To use it right of the bat hit the "Start the generator!" button and you're good to go. In the generator click the code of the color to change it and the double arrows in the color to move it.

And for the rest, I use Duck Duck Go, search "Color Picker" and play there with the color picker to see what I get.

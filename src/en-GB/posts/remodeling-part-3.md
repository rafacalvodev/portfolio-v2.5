This one for me was a bit hard at the beginning. I felt like a kid in a big toy store running through the aisles and being distracted by the shiniest and loudest toys.

For the last few months, and after the release of the [Version 1.0]() of my portfolio, I felt like I advanced quite fast in terms of stuff I've done. I re-igninted my interest in React, I began to play with [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) (which I stopped using a while ago before this new stage of re-interest), and learned a bunch of new stuff as a frontend developer. And eventually I felt like my original portfolio wasn't enough, and I've felt quite dissatisfied with it.
\
\
So, I decided to remake it from scratch, and this time I decided to add a blog in it and use a SSG to improve its speed and make it more robust. My first choice was [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), mostly because I'm more familiar with it (a long time ago I made a few projects with it and played with some starters to see how they worked), also I was about to go with [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) because everyone in Tech Twitter talked about it and gave it a quite amount of hype (which is very deserved, I't a fantastic framework and I'll use it for some projects), but I didn't had enough experience with it.
\
\
Now, I have the designs for my new portfolio (using Adobe XD, btw) with some mockups and was ready to begin coding. I used good ol' ´npm init gatsby´, and took my time to setup the corresponding plugins and some basic components. But, while I was feeling goo while doing this, I stopped and said: "Wait, do I really need all of this?". It dawned on me that Gatsby (and to some extent Next) has a bit too many bells and whistles for what I need it at the moment. So, I took a step back, and began to reorganize my thoughts and ideas.
\
\
Not long after, I stumbled with [11ty / Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and, after reading the documentation and play with it a few times, it clicked with me. It's speed and ease of use it's what I was looking for for my site, and also because I wanted to use CSS/Sass right away and [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) has allowed me to use it faster than the other options I tried.
\
\
As I write this post, I'm still learning more thing about [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), but I can say that I'm not feeling confused nor overwhelmed. Sure, it can do a lot of stuff that I haven't tried yet, but I have a sense of freedom and ease I haven't felt (yet, I think) from other Static Site Generator (from the ones I tried).

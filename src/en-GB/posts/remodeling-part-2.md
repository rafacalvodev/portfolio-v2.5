As a designer selecting good typography is always a journey. We lose quite some time looking for the most exciting and fun fonts out there to use in our project. We have a ton of resources to pick from that some times we feel overwhelmed.

While looking for the fonts I use for this site I read my fair share of articles/blog posts that talked about how to pick and use fonts for a website. Here are they key points I picked and will be using from now on:

- **Limit your fonts families.** This is, pick at most two fonts to use, one for the body and one for the titles. Another combination is one for the blog posts (if you have a blog) and another for the rest.

- **Make sure the font has various weights.** This is related to the previous tip, don't forget that ypu can use Â´font-weightÂ´ to emphasize the importance/hierarchy of the text you'll use in your site.

- **Don't go with "safe" fonts.** I don't have anything gainst the most used fonts out there (like Open Sans or Roboto), but I've seen them almost everywhere and they give a feeling of "neutrality" or "blandness", like the designer or dev behind it wanted to go with the flow or something. Give your site more identity, your type is one of the most important parts of your site (or app). I'm not saying to use something like Comic Sans or more illegible fonts, but to take your time looking for fonts thar attractive enough that can give you some identity and, at the same time, are legible enough for your visitors.

- **Use enough letter space.** Let your words breathe. A normal spacing for body text is `1px` or `2px`, that's enough space to let the words breathe and feel more readable. You can also use `letter-spacing: normal;` and call it a day ðŸ˜‚

#### Resources

Here's a small list of the sites I've used (and still use) to look for fonts:

- **[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).** One of the most known and used sites to look for fonts in the web. It's very popular because the fonts there are free and open source, and you can use them any time you want. This is the go-to site for many developers.

- **[Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/).** A very solid choice too (and one of my favorites). It's a more curated collection compared to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), it has lists of recommended fonts and it also has live examples of websites. It's also updated with the current trends in type.

- **[Beautiful Webtype](https://beautifulwebtype.com/).** Another well curated nad well presented collection of fonts. Most of the fonts here can be found in [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) but I really like the presentation on each font and the examples used to showcase their uses.

- **[Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/).** One of the top results when searching "Free Fonts". It's a quite vast collection of fonts and you can download them all (as far as I know) for free.
